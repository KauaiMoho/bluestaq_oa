Assumptions:

- Only one elevator in the building - multiple elevators could implement a better algorithm.
- People can only select a floor after calling the elevator - could implement a boolean flag for this, but would then limit elevator for one person only.
- Elevator commands can be called asynchonously at any time - elevator code runs on background thread.
